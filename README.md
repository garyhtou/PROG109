# PROG 109 (Programming 109) at Bellevue College

I took Programming 109 at Bellevue College during Winter 2021 as a Running Start student (high school dual-enrollment).

This repo contains my coursework.

- The home page is built with [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/), an amazing React Framework
- Assignments are plain old HTML/CSS/JS (located in [`/public`](/public)).
