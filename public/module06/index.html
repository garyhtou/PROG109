		<h1>Module 06: Mid-Term Feedback</h1>

		<h3>
			Which topics covered during the last weeks provided you with new
			knowledge?
		</h3>
		<p>
			Although I already had a decent grasp of the topics/concepts covered over
			the past weeks, it was a great review to go over the basics of Javascript
			since I was not familiar with some of the terms.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Which tools, methods, links, videos, etc., support your new skills? (i.e,
			did you use a new tool, video, site, etc.? Please share!
		</h3>
		<p>
			Most of my new learning stems from course material (textbook/linked
			resources). If I have any questions, I Google it, which generally brings
			me to W3Schools, Stack Overflow, or CSS Tricks.
		</p>

		<h3>What is your current grade in the class?</h3>
		<p>A (100%)</p>

		<h3>
			Is there anything I can do to improve your online learning experience?
		</h3>
		<p>
			Personally, this class has been going very smoothly for me. I don't have
			anything in mind that would help improve my online learning experience.
		</p>

		<h3>On average, how much time a week have you dedicated to this class?</h3>
		<p>3 hours.</p>
