				</p>
				<p>
					Before this class, I already had a solid understanding of HTML, CSS,
					and especially JavaScript. I had built multiple websites before
					(mainly using React.js) which allowed me to have a strong grasp of
					JavaScript. This course built on top of my exisiting knowledge and
					helped me fill in the missing gaps.

				</p>
				<p>
					For my portfolio, I used a template to help speed up the development
					process! The template I chose was
					<a href="https://html5up.net/massively">Massively</a> by HTML 5 Up.
					This theme provided advanced features such as CSS Animations and was
					extremely easy to work with. It became a solid baseline for styling
					the content I added to my portfolio.

					<strong
						>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the
						template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					I would say that my largest portfolio-related challenge stemed from
					the advanced CSS present in the template. Massively was built with
					various vender specific css rules which cause the CSS validator to
					throw warnings. With nearly 300 warnings, it would be extremely
					tedious to fix. Not even considering that removing these CSS rules
					would completely change the appearance and functionality of the
					site.<br />
					Another large challenge I faced as making sure the site was
					accessible. The template was not completely designed with
					accessibility in mind, as a result, there were a handful of edits I
					had to make to the template in order to pass the SiteImprove
					accessibility checker.

						>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					I think this class has allowed me to have a strong understanding of
					what a career in Web Development may look like. Although I believe
					nowadays, it may be uncommon in the industry to built a website out of
					plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it still represents the skills
					necessary in order to have a career in this field.<br />
					Personally, having this stronger understand has increased my dis-like
					for plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript websites. With having worked with
					React.js before, this course has put into perspective all of the
					various benifits which a React site has over a plain HTML, CSS, and
					JavaScript site. One example is is modifying the navagation bar (or
					footer) of a plain HTML site. You would need to make that edit on
					every single page. Although search and replace with regex may help
					speed this up, it is no match to a React site which features
					re-useable components.

				</p>
				<p>
					My most important recommendation is to learn about Flexboxes and
					become extremely fluent with them! Flexboxes are extremely useful for
					laying out a site to your desires.
					<br />Here is a great resource by CSS-TRICKS features
					<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"
						>A Complete Guide to Flexbox</a
